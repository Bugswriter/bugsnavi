#+TITLE: bugs navi OS

Navi (aka. bugsnavi) is a Auto Rice Bootstrapping script of [[https://bugswriter.com][bugswriter]].
Navi is a minimal script that will provide a fully-featured terminal based
OS.

I am writing this because I got bored with installing arch linux manually
All my friends keep asking me to make their systems exactly like me.
This is why I end up writing this script to make things quicker for me.

* Stage 0
First we have to get prepare for Arch installtion. Lets call it stage 0.
Reference: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide
#+begin_src sh
  echo "=== Welcome to navi OS installer script ==="
  echo "> Please make sure your internet is connected"
#+end_src

** Partition the disks
First and very important thing is making partition.
If you are intending to wipe your hard drive and install linux.
Then usually what I do is -
- =/dev/sda1= for efi (520mb)
- =/dev/sda2= for linux. (rest)
We are going to use =cfdisk= to make partition.
No need to create a new efi partition if it exist, unless you want to.
#+begin_src sh
  echo "Checkout your drive names"
  lsblk
  echo "Enter the complete drive name (eg. /dev/sda)"
  read drive
  cfdisk $drive
#+end_src

** Format the partitions
Now I assume you managed to create your linux and efi partition correctly.
- Now we have to give our linux partition =ext4= format.
- and our efi parition =fat32= format. (only if efi is made).
#+begin_src sh
  echo "Enter the complete name of linux partition you made (eg. /dev/sda1): "
  read partition
  mkfs.ext4 $partition
  read -p "Did you also create efi partition? [y/n]" answer
  if [[ $answer = y ]] ; then
      echo "Enter the full name of EFI partition (eg. /dev/sda2): "
      read efipartition
      mkfs.vfat -F 32 $efipartition
  fi
#+end_src
** Mount and Install
It's time to mount our brand new and empty linux partition we made. So we can
install our hot new arch linux kernel and packages.
#+begin_src sh
  mount $partition /mnt
  pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware
  genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab  
#+end_src
** Chroot Hack
So right now we are in our arch image system. But in order to configure our new
installation we have to change our root to new linux partition. For that we
have to use =arch-chroot=. But since we are running commands from script.
If we do chroot, we won't be able to run commands.
One solution for this is just use =arch-chroot /mnt <command>=. This will
chroot - run command - exit.
We also have to type =arch-chroot /mnt= before every command.
So what I did is. I am not going to exit out this shell script, but before
exiting, we are gonna make a new shell script on =/mnt/= or for new system.
The root (=/=). Then we will =arch-chroot /mnt ./new_script.sh=.
#+begin_src sh
  #stage1
  sed '1,/^#stage1$/d' `basename $0` > /mnt/stage1.sh
  chmod +x /mnt/stage1.sh
  arch-chroot /mnt ./stage1.sh
  exit
#+end_src
